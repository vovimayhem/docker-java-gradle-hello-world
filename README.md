# Java 4 Docker: Java Gradle "Hello World"

This project is my attempt at following the
["Building Java Projects with Gradle"](https://spring.io/guides/gs/gradle/#scratch)
guide at [spring.io](https://spring.io), but this time using Docker exclusively
for the development process :)

## Prerequisites

1. Have Docker & Docker Compose Installed
2. Clone the project
3. Move to the cloned project's folder

## Run Demo

```
docker-compose run hello_world
```
